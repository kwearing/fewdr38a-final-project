            <h1>About Nippers</h1>
            <p>Nippers is a beach education program that introduces children aged 5 to 14 years to lifesaving. Nipper Education Programs are delivered at Life Saving Clubs across Victoria throughout summer.</p>
            <p><strong>The aim of the Nippers program is to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop surf awareness</li>
                <li>Increase confidence and skills in beach related activities</li>
                <li>Instil and re-enforce SunSmart philosophies</li>
                <li>Encourage enjoyable and healthy participation</li>
                <li>Meet new friends and most importantly&mdash;HAVE FUN!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Nipper Education Program caters for all manner of experience and skill levels of participants. The emphasis is focused on fun and education, regardless of development stages to ensure experiences are positive and affirmative. It is important to recognise that young people have varying learning abilities that need to be catered for throughout all programs.</p>

            <p><strong>Typical activities include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play it safe in the water</li>
                <li>Identify what a lifesaver looks like</li>
                <li>Awareness of lifesaving signals</li>
                <li>Surf skills of beach sprints, wading, dolphin diving, surf race, beach flags and the most fun boards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Skills and activities have been designed to progressively develop the essential skills of Nippers as they move through each age group. The lessons are presented in an easy to follow manner to ensure they can be delivered by all Age Managers regardless of experience.</p>

            <p><strong>What should I bring?</strong>
            <p>It is the responsibility of parents to ensure Nippers are Sun Smart and well hydrated while on the beach. The club cap and pink rash vest is compulsory during sessions for easy identification and nippers should wear the Aspendale rash vests over their bathers and the Aspendale cap. Aspendale rash vests and caps are available to purchase on Sunday before nippers. Don't forget to name your cap as there will be over 100 identical caps on the beach</p>
            <p>Towel, hat, sunscreen, drink bottle, snacks and warm clothes are also useful. </p>

            <h3 id="surf-ed">SURF EDUCATION AWARDS</h3>
            <p>Many activities that nippers undergo are conducted in the water. To ensure that all nippers have a suitable swimming ability to allow them to participate in these activities, Surf Life Saving Australia has developed a Junior Preliminary Skills Assessment for each age group. This is done in the pool or ocean and can be signed off by your child's swimming teacher prior to nippers starting. Every nipper must participate in this evaluation, prior to participating in any water activity. If the nipper shows successful demonstration of the Preliminary Skills Assessment a second assessment known as the Competition Skills Evaluation needs to be completed. Competition Skills Evaluations will take place during the first few weeks of the start of the season weather providing. If the weather is inclement, we will advise on other dates for the skills testing. These are two different assessments, and one cannot be used to qualify a child for the other requirement. Your child's pathway through the nipper's program is summarised here.</p>

            <h3 id="parental">PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT</h3>
            <p>As a voluntary organisation we need help from you, (parents and guardians), to be able to make our Nipper program an enjoyable experience for all our Nippers. Parents and Care Givers are invited and encouraged to share the experiences of junior activities with their children. We have an expectation that parents will take up a role within the nipper program.</p>
            <p>Our program cannot run without parents stepping up to become Age Managers and Water safety officers. In addition, our nippers cannot compete at carnivals unless we have the required amount of Club Officials on the beach.</p>
            <p>For both Age Managers and Officials, full training is provided, and no experience is necessary. It is a great way to be actively involved in your children's sport.</p>

            <p><strong>OFFICIALS</strong></p>
            <p>This is an opportunity to assist with the running of events at Nipper Carnivals and is a great way to get involved and help the kids enjoy competition. The club will provide training to get you started. We appreciate your support in these roles, as it ensures we can continue running a safe, fun and enjoyable program for the kids. To get involved please <a href="mailto:nippers@aspendalelsc.org">contact our Coordinators</a>.</p>
            <p>All parents are expected to help when their child's age group is rostered on for duties. Duties may include, activity beach set up, pack up and most importantly cooking the BBQ to feed all our hungry nippers after a session.Parents must hold a voluntary Working with Children's Check.  If you currently hold a Check, you will need to provide details when registering your nipper. Your approved WWCC details will then be linked to your membership.</p>

            <p><strong>WHY DO I NEED A WORKING WITH CHILDREN'S CHECK?</strong></p>
